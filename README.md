# React + TypeScript + Vite + Electron

This is both a Web and Desktop app that is compiled with electron-builer from the Electron framework. It uses a Java backend where common data structures and algorithms are implemented from scratch. The app in and of itself provides information on these data structures and algorithms, and visualizes multiple algorithms.
